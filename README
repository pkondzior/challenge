== Challange Application

Application after clone and bundle install should be available out of
box. It supports only HTML5 compatible browsers (Firefox 3.5+, Chrome
3+, Safari 4) because i base my progress indication solution on XHR 2
so it wont be fully working under IE and other legacy browser.

Files are uploaded into Rails.root('tmp/') because heroku is mostly
Read Only FS clooud solution, so this is workaround to match application
to the challenge specification.
